  <h2>Q&A</h2>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why am I working on coding and web development?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> I <u>LOVE</u> to learn new things, want a new challenge, and am looking at a career change.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> What am I looking for?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> A company who is willing to help me learn and grow. I am looking for a long-term position where
    I can move up in the company over time.</p>

  <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why a website about dogs?<br>
    <strong>A:</strong> I love my dogs, have a LOT of pictures of them, and have a lot of knowledge about them. It was
    just a topic for me to start with to learn how to make and design a website using a variety of techniques (the
    majority coming from <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>). I also am interested in
    fitness and may create another website about that in the future.</p>
